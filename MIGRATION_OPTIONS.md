## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I run it multiple times?**
A: Yes! It's safe to run multiple times - it skips already-migrated users.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**
A: See rollback procedure in `FIREBASE_MIGRATION_QUERIES.md`

**Q: Do I need the service account file?**
A: Only for CLI scripts (Option 2 & 3). Homepage migration doesn't need it.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: Depends on your database size:
- < 100 users: < 1 minute
- 100-1000 users: 1-5 minutes
- 1000+ users: 5-10 minutes

**Q: Will it affect my users?**
A: No - it's a background update. Users won't be logged out.

**Q: Can users change their username?**
A: Yes! After migration, users can change usernames from `/profile` page.
