This is a professional blog web application built with Next.js 15, Firebase, and Resend.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage)
- **Email**: Resend
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Typography plugin

## Architecture Principles
- Clean separation of concerns
- Service-based architecture for external integrations
- Server and client components appropriately used
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- JavaScript throughout (no TypeScript)
